# Self-Governing Catalyst

A mod for Minecraft Fabric. It adds a single block - the Self-Governing Catalyst, which functions similarly to the Autonomous Activator and the Mechanical User.  
**Requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-language-kotlin)**

The Self-Governing Catalyst has 3 buttons within its GUI:    
**Click**: Left-click or Right-click. Lets the Self-Governing Catalyst simulate either player left-click or right-click.  
**Aim**: Straight, (slight) Up or (slight) down. Changes the vertical direction (pitch) of the simulated player's aim. Note that the aim direction will remain the same (straight) even if you change between them when the Self-Governing Catalyst is facing directly up or down.  
**Redstone**: Ignore, Low or High. Changes the Redstone signal the block has to receive to activate it.
