# Self-Governing Catalyst

A mod for Minecraft Fabric. It adds a single block - the Self-Governing Catalyst, which functions similarly to the Autonomous Activator and the Mechanical User.  
**Requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-language-kotlin)**

The Self-Governing Catalyst can be set to either left-click or right-click. Its aim direction can also be changed between straight, slight up, and slight down.  
Note that the aim direction will remain the same (straight) even if you change between them when the Self-Governing Catalyst is facing directly up or down.
